]
.right-column[
`Traffic Control` is a caching server control plane suite of service-based components which are used to aggregate caching servers into a Content Delivery Network (CDN). 

The CDN caching proxies for Traffic Control are:
- [Apache Traffic Server (ATS)](http://trafficserver.apache.org) - software is a fast, scalable and extensible HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0 compliant caching proxy server.

- [Grove](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/tree/master/grove) - a Traffic Control Caching Server written in Go, implementing RFC 7234
